I recently started a project to build Cyn from Murder Drones in real life. The Python program I wrote in VS Code is for the eyes only. I've written this code to make the animatronic Cyn a little more lifelike.
It blinks, the eyes move as if it's looking around, it makes multiple expressions, and it's eyes can also either become Golden Retriever JPEGs, or the Absolute Solver symbol. 
My goal is to make this project as show-accurate as possible. My inspiration is Death Templer on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/@DeathTempler


Ok, this part is super important: 

Make absolute SURE to read the commented instructions at the beginning of the code. 
It tells you how to get the proper images to make the Absolute Solver and Golden Retriever JPEG eyes work
