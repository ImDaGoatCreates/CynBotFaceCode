I recently started a project to build Cyn from Murder Drones in real life. The Python program I wrote in VS Code that will work as a training software for an AI model. 
I want to give it control of the face and allow it to make different expressions depending on its surroundings or user input. This is my plan: give the AI fake scenarios and then show it the 
appropriate expression ripped from the training program so that it learns how to respond to the events around it; if it succesfully responds to the situation, it's rewarded. 
If it fails, it's punished. My vision is that it will be able to show "emotion" and give the illusion of life.
